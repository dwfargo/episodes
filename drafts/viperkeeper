Odessa and Trousers were given quarters in the old vicar’s office on the upper floor. The Keeper had constructed a makeshift bed out of old crates and a spare mattress from his bedroom. Eunice brough spare blankets and pillows. 
	“Thank you very much for your hospitality, Mr. Keeper... and Eunice,” said Odessa.
	The Keeper took Eunice’s hand and held it softly. Eunice smiled at him, and rested her head on his broad shoulders. The Keeper nodded his bulky, balding head and smiled. 
	“You’re very welcome. I hope you and Mr. Cat can find that painting you’ve been looking for. We could really use the money.”
	Trousers pawed at Odessa’s leg. “I don’t mean to be rude,” he said bluntly, “but it has been a long day, and we are on borrowed time.”
The Keeper took the hint. 
“Eh, breakfast is served after eight o’clock,” he said softly. “Get what you can while the food cart is here, or you’ll stay hungry until the evening rounds.”
	“Don’t mind Trousers,” said Odessa assuringly. “He’s just a cat. I do hope you have the painting our client is looking for. Thank you again for your hospitality.”
	The Keeper handed her a book of matches and quietly excused himself.
Odessa fueled the small furnace with fresh wood and stretched out on the blankets in the surprisingly sturdy bed. She stared up at the arched ceiling and replayed the days events in her mind. 
“There is no way the Keeper does everything by himself. There has to be more help than just Eunice. Poor lady. My father got bit by a snake once. It was a dry bite, but from a cobra. Trousers, do you think a cat could outsmart a cobra?”
 Trousers was already snoring on the pillow at her feet. Odessa took that as a sign. She closed her eyes and waited for sleep to take her.  
Sleep never came.

Odessa put on a clean pair of socks and tiptoed across the room and to the door. Trousers was still asleep. Good, she thought.  If I wake him, he’ll start asking questions. Odessa quietly opened the wooden door and slipped through.
